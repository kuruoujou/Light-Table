ECE 362 Light Table
===================
This is the Light Table project for ECE 362, Fall 2011. This box
could be easily converted to a table, and is designed primarily for visual effect.
It has an array of LEDs which change in intensity based on the proximity of a hand
or object to the table, with 4 modules acting independantly in a 2x2 grid. Additionally,
the color of the table will change in cold or warm conditions.

The table uses simple temperature resistor sensors, infrared emmiters and receviers (similar
to what is on a tv remote and receiver), and dual-color LEDs to function. The processing is done
by a freescale microcontroller, and code for it is written in C and Assembly.

It is packaged in clear acrylic, covered with simple glass frosting, with styrofoam inside to 
insulate for the temperature sensors directionally, such that temperature readings only come from
the top of the table.

More Information
================
You can contact any of the contributors to this repository for more information on the project,
including a detailed description of where we got the idea, how to set it up, what we did, what
we would do differently, etc. if you are interested.
